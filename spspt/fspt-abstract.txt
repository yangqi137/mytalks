Towards a classification of fermionic crystalline SPT states

Abstract:
In this talk, I will briefly review our recent efforts towards a classification of fermionic crystalline-symmetry-protected topological states, which are based on two approaches. First, using the crystalline equivalence principle proposed by Thorngren and Else, the classification can be computed by treating the crystalline symmetries as onsite symmetries. We develop an algorithm that allows a fast computation of such classification for complex symmetry groups, including the space groups. Second, we use a real-space construction to build crystalline SPT states from lower-dimensional building blocks, which are topological states protected by onsite symmetries. I will discuss the progress and difficulties we are facing in each approach.
