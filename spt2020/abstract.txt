Computing the classification of symmetry-protected topological phases with homological algebra

Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are quantum states of matter beyond the Landau paradigm of classifying phases by symmetry breaking. Mathematically, the classification of such SPT phases are described as generalized cohomology theories. In this talk, I will first give a brief review of the SPT phases and how to classify them using the cohomology of groups. Then I will discuss two recent works on computing the classification of SPT phases: First, we classify crystalline-symmetry-protected topological phases using a spectral sequence, which can be viewed as a recipe for real-space constructions of such topological phases. Second, we are working on a software package that computes the classification of fermionic SPT phases automatically.
