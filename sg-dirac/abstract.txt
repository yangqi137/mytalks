Classification of topological crystalline insulators and superconductors protected by space-group symmetries

Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and topological crystalline superconductors (TCSs) are topological states protected by crystalline symmetries such as the point-group symmetry and the space-group symmetry. In this work, we give a systematic approach for classifying free-fermion topological states protected by space-group symmetries. In particular, we argue that the crystalline equivalence principle introduced by Thorngren and Else also applies to free-fermion systems, and topological states protected by space-group symmetries can be classified by considering blocks of Hamiltonian carrying different irreducible representations of the space-group symmetry, which can be viewed as Dirac Hamiltonians at the corresponding momenta.
