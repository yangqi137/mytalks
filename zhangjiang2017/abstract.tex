\title{Quantum spin liquids with fractionalized excitations}
\begin{abstract}
Quantum spin liquids belong to a new class of phases of matter called topological orders, featuring fractionalized quasiparticle excitations carrying both fractional statistics and fractional symmetry quantum numbers.
One promising place to search for quantum spin liquids is frustrated spin-$\frac12$ quantum magnets, where the nontrivial Berry phase of the half-integer spins has a profound connection to the existence of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids.
In this talk, I will explain how is the half-integer spins in the physical model related to the topological order and symmetry fractionalization of the quantum spin liquids that can be realized in such models.
