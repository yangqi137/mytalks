Emergent U(1) symmetry and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a triangular-lattice quantum Ising material TmMgGaO4

The low-energy physics of TmMgGaO4 is described by a triangular-lattice transverse-field antiferromagnetic Ising model. This model has an emergent U(1) symmetry and two Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions at finite temperatures.x
